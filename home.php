				<img src="img/butterfly.jpg" width="300" style="margin-left: 5px;" class="pic">
				<p>&#160Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. Adult &#160butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily &#160Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent &#160analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea"). Butterfly fossils date to the &#160Paleocene, which was about 56 million years ago.</p>

				<p>&#160Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth &#160year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the &#160early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford &#160Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer &#160to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.</p>

				<img src="img/panda.jpg" width="300" style="margin-left: 5px;" class="pic">
				<p>&#160For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with &#160both bears and raccoons However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These &#160studies &#160show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the &#160group, it &#160is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.</p>

				<p>&#160Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature &#160phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet &#160(including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), &#160alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically include various sensors that can be &#160leveraged by their software, such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope and accelerometer, and support &#160wireless communications protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and satellite navigation.</p>
